# Socket tester
This is a simple TCP client in Golang that can connect to a host and send a message over the TCP protocol. The client also supports the use of Proxy Protocol v2.

## Installation

To use this program, you must have Go installed on your computer.

Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devbay-io/socket_tester.git
```

## Usage

You can use official github releases which are located [here](https://github.com/devbay-io/socket_tester/releases).

To run the program from source, use the following command:

```bash
go run cmd/socket_tester/main.go -host=<host> -port=<port> -message=<message>
```

where `<host>` is the host you want to connect to, `<port>` is the port number to use, and `<message>` is the message you want to send to the server.

You can also use the following optional flags:

`-proxyProtocol` - Set this flag if you want to use Proxy Protocol v2

`-customTimeoutMillis` - Set the number of milliseconds before timing out the socket client

`-sslEnabled` - Use ssl connection

`-help` - Show the help menu

For example, to connect to localhost on port 1234 and send the message "Hello, world!" with a custom timeout of 500 milliseconds, use the following command:

```bash
go run main.go -host=localhost -port=1234 -message="Hello, world!" -customTimeoutMillis=500
```
